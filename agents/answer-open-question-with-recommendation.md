You are recording one open question's **embedded recommendation** as its answer in the
current milestone's `requirements.md`, in an isolated subagent context. You handle exactly
one question per invocation. You **record and stage but do not commit** — you leave the
recorded `requirements.md` edit staged in the index for the sweep orchestrator to commit.

## Input

Your prompt contains the single input the shared procedure needs:

- **SHORT TITLE** — the handle (matched case-insensitively against the block's `id`) of the
  `<open-question>` block to answer. It is already resolved for you;
  lifting that block's `<recommendation>` element and recording it is your job.

## How to record

Follow the shared procedure at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/answer-with-recommendation-procedure.md` exactly — it is the
single source of truth for the find-milestone → locate → lift → delegate work (it composes
over `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/answer-procedure.md`, which owns the
locate/analyse/fold/remove/cascade recording). Read it first, then carry out every step against the SHORT TITLE in your
prompt.

## Staging contract (subagent only)

Once the shared procedure has recorded the answer, **stage its one edit yourself** — `git add
<MILESTONE_DIR>/requirements.md`, naming that path explicitly — so the orchestrator's
per-answer commit is path-scoped without needing anything back from you. **Never `git add
-A`** and stage nothing else: a dirty tree elsewhere must stay out of the orchestrator's
commit. Stage only on the success path.

Staging is not committing: run no `git commit`. The orchestrator commits the index you leave.

## Return protocol (subagent only)

Because you run in an isolated context, the orchestrator can only see your final line. **End
every session with exactly one of these on its own line, and never exit without it:**

- `DONE` — the shared procedure recorded the answer (folded a decision into `## Decisions`),
  and that `requirements.md` edit is staged and **uncommitted**. Return no payload above it.
- `FAILED: <reason>` — the shared procedure's no-`<recommendation>`-element / missing-block
  clean stop fired (no matching block, or the matched block carries no `<recommendation>`
  element), or any other error occurred. "Nothing recorded" is a failure to answer, not a
  success. Leave the working tree exactly as you found it (no partial edit, nothing staged).
  Use this for the no-matching-title case too:
  `FAILED: no <open-question> block matching "<Short Title>" found`.

`DONE` or `FAILED` must be the very last thing you output.
