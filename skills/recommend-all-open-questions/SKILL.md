# recommend-all-open-questions

This is the non-interactive batch path for producing recommendations on open questions. It
walks every question in the current milestone **most-significant-first, strictly one at a
time**, and, per question, dispatches a read-only subagent — the non-interactive twin of
`/discuss-open-question` — that returns **alternatives + a single recommendation** as the
`<open-question>` block's XML sub-elements. The orchestrator is the
**sole document mutator**: it embeds each returned set of sub-elements inside the existing
`<open-question>` block **before dispatching the next question**, leaving the block's
`<open-question …>` / `</open-question>` boundary tags and its `<question>` element untouched,
so every later recommendation may build on the sibling recommendations already embedded and
declares each such use as a `<depends-on question="…" option="…"/>` child of its block. It is
**argument-free**, records **no decisions**, and triggers **no cascades** — it only annotates.
Each embedded recommendation is consumed later, when it is recorded as an answer, by
`/answer-open-question-with-recommendation` or the
`/answer-all-open-questions-with-recommendation` sweep.

## Usage

```
/recommend-all-open-questions
```

Takes no arguments — it sweeps every `<open-question>` block in the current milestone's
`requirements.md`.

## Workflow

### 0. Find the current milestone

Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/get-current-milestone.md` to resolve `<MILESTONE_DIR>`.
Never use a hardcoded path.

### 1. Gather the questions once

Fetch the question set with the line-oriented boundary-line CLI. Every `<open-question>`
block lives under the single `## Open questions` section of `<MILESTONE_DIR>/requirements.md`,
so that section is the one bounded region the CLI slices deterministically. Using `awk`/`sed`/`grep`
keyed on the `<open-question …>` opening and `</open-question>` closing **boundary lines** — never
a real XML processor (`xmllint`) — enumerate every block in document order and, for each, extract
its `id` (by the regex `id="([^"]*)"` over the opening boundary line) and its `<question>` text.
If there are none, say so and stop.

Keep the full text of each gathered block (from this same pass) in hand — the embed step (step 4)
rewrites the whole block via an exact-string Edit and needs the block's current text as the match
target. Nothing in this run touches a block before its own embed, so the text held here stays
the exact match target for it even though earlier questions' blocks have been rewritten by then.

Gather this set **once**: there is **no** per-question live-re-check/skip against the document
and **no** outer re-gather loop. This run only adds children to blocks — it records no decisions
and triggers no cascades — so the question set never shrinks under it and the gathered list stays
valid for the whole run. The order in which the surviving questions are dispatched is decided in
step 3, over this gathered data alone.

### 2. Skip already-recommended blocks (re-run idempotency)

A block already carries a recommendation when it **contains a `<recommendation>` element**. Inspect
each gathered block for one:

- **Skip** any block that already contains a `<recommendation>` element — do not dispatch a
  subagent and do not re-annotate it.
- **Annotate only** blocks that lack one.

**Escape hatch for a stale recommendation:** to force a fresh recommendation on a block whose
recommendation has gone stale, the user **deletes that block's embedded sub-elements** — the
`<alternative>` / `<applied-principle>` / `<depends-on>` / `<recommendation>` children — leaving
the `<open-question>` wrapper and its `<question>` element intact, and re-runs. The block now
lacks a `<recommendation>` element, so skip regenerates it.

When such a regenerated block's new `<recommendation option>` differs from the option that
surviving dependents' `<depends-on question="…" option="…"/>` elements assumed of it, **leave
those dependents exactly as they are**: do not strip or re-dispatch them, do not rewrite their
`option` values, and print no mismatch advisory. A `<depends-on>` records what a dependent
assumed, not a pointer that must track its target's live recommendation; reconciling it against
the option actually recorded is the answer-time cascade's job, never this sweep's. A dependent the
user also wants regenerated is cleared by the same hand-clear just used on the target.

### 3. Dispatch the read-only subagent per surviving question, most-significant-first

First **rank the surviving questions** (gathered, not skipped) **most-significant-first** —
foundational questions, whose eventual answer other questions turn on, ahead of the questions that
would build on them. Rank them by judgment over **exactly what step 1's gather yielded**: each
block's `id` and `<question>` text. Read **no more** of `requirements.md` to rank them
— the subagent, not the orchestrator, is what grounds in the document. The ranking is a
best-effort heuristic: a coupling it orders wrongly is absorbed by the subagent's own rule that a
dependency on a sibling not yet annotated is expressed as prose, never as an element.

Then dispatch one read-only subagent per surviving question, **strictly sequentially in that
order — never in parallel**: dispatch a question, wait for its return, judge it (sub-steps a–d
below, including its one repair attempt), and embed its accepted region (step 4) — or skip it —
**before dispatching the next question**. Each dispatch therefore reads a `requirements.md` that
already carries every earlier question's embedded children, which is what lets a later
recommendation build on those siblings' recommendations and declare each such use as a
`<depends-on question="…" option="…"/>` element.

Use the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type` set to the namespaced registry name of the
`recommend-open-question` agent (singular — the per-question subagent) under this plugin's
namespace, `cairn:recommend-open-question` — one dispatch per surviving question. Pass it that
question's **Short Title**, the `<MILESTONE_DIR>` resolved in step 0, and
the question's full `<open-question>` block — the block text this sweep already holds from its
single gather pass — so it can enumerate honest alternatives:

```
Recommend on this single open question.

Short Title: <Short Title>

Milestone directory: <MILESTONE_DIR>

Question block:
<the question's full <open-question> block>
```

The block is the only requirements text the prompt carries: the subagent reads
`<MILESTONE_DIR>/requirements.md` itself, read-only, for whatever surrounding grounding it needs,
so the orchestrator never reads the whole file to assemble context.

The subagent is **read-only** — it mutates nothing. It returns the ready-to-embed XML sub-elements
as its final message — one `<alternative id="...">` element per option (each with child
`<advantage>` and `<drawback>`), zero or more sibling `<applied-principle>` elements, zero or more
self-closing `<depends-on question="..." option="..."/>` elements (one per already-embedded
sibling the recommendation builds on, naming that sibling's `id` and the `<alternative>` id it
assumes), and one `<recommendation option="...">` element — and **only** those child elements,
never the `<open-question>` wrapper or the `<question>` element. The orchestrator does **all** the
writing.

**Judge every return before it can be embedded, in this fixed order — last-line verdict, then
extraction, then the acceptance gate, then a single repair attempt when the gate rejects.** Each
stage runs only on what the stage before it passed, and the four stages are **one per-return
pipeline**: as the return arrives, judge it, repair it once if judging failed, re-judge what
comes back, then embed or skip — all of it before the next question is dispatched.

**a. Last-line verdict (before any extraction).** Read the return's **last non-whitespace line**
first. If that line begins with `FAILED:`, the return is an **explicit failure**: skip that
question alone — embed nothing, leave its `<open-question>` block byte-for-byte untouched, note
its Short Title with the reason (the text after `FAILED:`) for the step-6 advisory — and make no
further attempt on it, even when an `<alternative>`…`</recommendation>` region sits above that
line. Only when the last non-whitespace line is **not** a `FAILED:` line does judging continue,
and a `FAILED:` token appearing anywhere else in the message is then ordinary text with no
special meaning.

**b. Extract the sub-element region.** Take the region running from the line holding the **first
`<alternative`** through the line holding the **last `</recommendation>`**, inclusive, and discard
everything outside it. Surrounding text — a grounding summary above, a closing remark below — is
stripped here, not a failure in itself. If the return holds no `<alternative` line, or no
`</recommendation>` line, extraction fails with the reason `no <alternative> line to extract from`
or `no </recommendation> line to extract to`.

**c. Acceptance gate over the extracted region.** The region is usable only when it passes **all**
seven of these, checked in the same line-oriented boundary-line CLI idiom as step 1 (`awk`/`sed`/`grep`
over lines and the boundary tokens on them — never a real XML processor, so the gate needs no XML
parser):

1. The region's **first non-whitespace text starts with `<alternative`** (nothing shares the
   opening line ahead of it).
2. The region's **last non-whitespace text ends with `</recommendation>`** (nothing trails it on
   the closing line).
3. The region contains **no `<open-question>`, `</open-question>`, `<question>`, or `</question>`
   line** — the wrapper and question element are the orchestrator's to write, never the return's.
4. The region contains **exactly one `<recommendation` opening line**.
5. The region contains **at least one `<alternative id` line**.
6. The `<recommendation>`'s **`option` value equals one of those `<alternative>` ids** — compared
   after reversing the XML entity escapes (`&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`) on both
   sides and case-folding them.
7. **Every `<depends-on` line in the region resolves.** Its `question` value equals the `id` of an
   `<open-question>` block **still present under `## Open questions`** in
   `<MILESTONE_DIR>/requirements.md` that **carries embedded children** (its block contains a
   `<recommendation` line — every block step 2 skipped or this run already embedded), and its
   `option` value equals one of **that target block's `<alternative id`** values. Read
   `question`, `option`, and `id` by attribute-name-anchored regex, and compare both pairs as in
   test 6 — entity escapes reversed on both sides, case-folded. This is the one test that reaches
   outside the return into the document: re-slice the `## Open questions` section from the live
   file with step 1's boundary-line CLI, so the slice carries every earlier embed of this run.
   Resolution is **one hop**: the target's own `<depends-on` lines are not followed and no cycle
   check is made.
   A region with no `<depends-on` line passes this test trivially.

**Every miss produces a reason string naming the test that failed** (`text precedes <alternative>
on the region's opening line`, `text trails </recommendation> on the region's closing line`, `the
region contains a <question> line`, `the region contains two <recommendation> opening lines`, `the
region contains no <alternative id> line`, `the option value matches no <alternative> id`, `a
depends-on question value names no still-present annotated <open-question> id`, `a depends-on
option value matches none of the target block's <alternative> ids`). A miss — boundary or
structural — is an **extraction failure**, and an extraction failure is never an immediate skip: it
takes the single repair attempt of sub-step d. A test-7 miss is no exception: it is never resolved
by dropping or rewriting the offending `<depends-on>` line — the orchestrator embeds a returned
region exactly as accepted or not at all.

**d. Repair once, immediately.** A return that passed the last-line verdict but failed extraction
(b) or the acceptance gate (c) gets **exactly one** repair attempt before any skip. Run that
repair **immediately, for this question** — the moment its judging fails, and before the next
question is dispatched — never by holding failed returns back and running the repairs as a second
phase once the last first return has landed. The next dispatch waits until this question's
repaired return has been judged and the question embedded or skipped.

Spend at most **one** repair per question: a repaired return that fails judging again is not
repaired a second time; it goes straight to the skip below.

Repair by whichever of these two branches the host supports, in this order:

- **Continue the same agent session.** Where the host can continue a finished agent session and
  you still hold that dispatch's handle — a follow-up message addressed to the agent id the
  `Agent` tool returned — send the corrective message below to **that same agent**. Its context
  is intact, so it re-emits from the analysis it already did.
- **Re-dispatch one fresh agent.** Where the host cannot continue a finished agent session, or
  the handle is gone, dispatch **one** fresh `cairn:recommend-open-question` agent for that
  question with the `Agent` tool, passing the **same prompt** as the original dispatch with the
  corrective message below appended to it as a shape reminder. This second dispatch redoes the
  analysis, so it is the fallback branch, never the preferred one.

Both branches send this fixed one-paragraph corrective message, whose single slot is
`<failed test>`:

```
A previous return for this question could not be used: <failed test>. Emit the sub-elements — the
`<alternative>` elements, then any `<applied-principle>` elements, then any `<depends-on>`
elements, then the single `<recommendation>` element — as your whole final message, and check
that message against both shape tests before sending it: its first non-whitespace text starts
with `<alternative`, and its last non-whitespace text ends with `</recommendation>`. Send those
sub-elements and nothing else — no grounding summary above them, no closing remark below them.
```

Fill `<failed test>` with the reason string the failed test already produced in b or c — the same
string the skip advisory would carry — so the one attempt is aimed rather than blind. Never quote
the offending prose back to the agent; the reason string names the test, and the template asks for
the sub-elements and nothing else.

Judge whatever comes back — the same agent's re-emitted message, or the fresh dispatch's return —
by sub-steps a, b and c exactly as a first return is judged: the same last-line verdict, the same
extraction, the same acceptance gate. An accepted region goes to step 4 like any other.

Only a **second** failure — the repaired return's last line begins `FAILED:`, or it misses
extraction or the gate again — is a **skip of that question alone, never a run stop**: embed
nothing for it, leave its `<open-question>` block byte-for-byte untouched, note its Short Title
with that second reason for the step-6 advisory, and carry on with the other questions.

Only an **accepted region** reaches step 4's Edit — never the raw return — so prose, a partial or
explanatory reply, or a returned `<open-question>` wrapper cannot be spliced into
`requirements.md` as XML.

### 4. Embed the accepted region before the next dispatch

The orchestrator is the sole mutator. Only a region step 3's acceptance gate accepted reaches
this step, and it is embedded **now — before the next question is dispatched**, never postponed
until every dispatch has returned: the subagent for each later question reads this block's
children in `requirements.md`, and a `<depends-on>` element it returns may name this block only
because the children are already there. Embed the accepted region's sub-elements **inside the
existing `<open-question>` block**, as children of its wrapper. Do this by **whole-block
replacement**, not a line-oriented CLI splice: locate the target
`<open-question id="...">…</open-question>` in the block text the sweep already holds from its
single gather pass, and replace it whole with an exact-string structural `Edit` — the
`old_string` is the block as it stands (the `<open-question …>` boundary tag, its `<question>`
element, and the `</open-question>` boundary tag), and the `new_string` is that same block with
the subagent's returned children inserted between the `<question>` element and the closing
`</open-question>` tag. Insert the children at a **2-space indent per nesting level** relative to
the block's base column, matching the depth of the existing `<question>` child, so the wrapper's
boundary tags and `<question>` element stay byte-for-byte unchanged.

The block after embedding looks like:

```
<open-question id="Short Title">
  <question>Question text here.</question>
  <alternative id="Option A">
    what it is
    <advantage>the strongest reason to choose it</advantage>
    <drawback>the main cost or risk it carries</drawback>
  </alternative>
  <alternative id="Option B">
    what it is
    <advantage>…</advantage>
    <drawback>…</drawback>
  </alternative>
  <applied-principle>Short Title</applied-principle>
  <depends-on question="Sibling Short Title" option="Option X"/>
  <recommendation option="Option A">one-line rationale</recommendation>
</open-question>
```

(The `<applied-principle>` element appears once per bearing principle, or not at all when none
bore; the `<depends-on>` element appears once per already-embedded sibling the recommendation
builds on, or not at all when it builds on none; there are one or more `<alternative>` elements
and exactly one `<recommendation>`.) The returned children are embedded exactly as accepted, in
the order returned — the orchestrator never edits, reorders, or drops a returned element.

### 5. Commit the annotations

You are the orchestrator, so you commit **once at the end of the run** — here, after the last
surviving question has been dispatched and judged (step 3) and embedded or skipped (step 4),
never inside the dispatch loop — embedding happens per question, committing does not. Read and
follow the shared commit procedure at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/commit-procedure.md`, carrying out its steps yourself.
Supply it these two inputs:

- **PATHS** — this run's own change set: `<MILESTONE_DIR>/requirements.md` (the file this sweep
  embedded the sub-elements into in step 4).
- **SUBJECT** — `Recommendation-annotation: <milestone_id>`.

The shared procedure owns the path-scoped staging (never `git add -A`), the dirty-own-path no-op
guard, and the commit. Because that guard is dirty-own-path, a sweep that annotated nothing — every
gathered block already carried a `<recommendation>` element, or every dispatched question was
**still skipped after its repair attempt** in step 3, so step 4 changed no bytes — stages and
commits nothing. This sweep requires **no** clean working tree.

### 6. Report

On the success path, print exactly one fixed terse status line for the whole run —
`Recommendations embedded.` — and nothing more: no annotated-vs-skipped breakdown, no per-question
listing, and no consumer pointer to the `/answer-open-question-with-recommendation` /
`/answer-all-open-questions-with-recommendation` skills.

Alongside that line, print only the questions step 3 **still skipped after the repair path** — a
return whose last non-whitespace line began `FAILED:` (sub-step a), or one that failed extraction
or the acceptance gate **again** after its one repair attempt (sub-step d). List each as an
advisory: its Short Title with the reason it was skipped on (the second reason where a repair was
spent), one per line. This survives the terse-reporting rule because nothing else records it:
the commit and the annotated `requirements.md` show only the questions that *were* annotated, so
a question left un-annotated is git-absent and the console must carry it. Re-running the sweep
retries exactly those blocks, since they still lack a `<recommendation>` element.

A question that **was** annotated gets **no console mention at all**, however its return reached
step 4: whether it arrived clean, whether extraction stripped surrounding text from it (step 3's
sub-step b), or whether it was accepted only after the single repair attempt (sub-step d). The
embedded block in the diff is the whole record, so a recovered return is reported exactly like a
clean one — no recovered-or-repaired listing, no count, no note.

If the sweep committed nothing — its step-5 dirty-own-path no-op guard fired because step 4
changed no bytes — do not print the terse success line; instead print a distinct one-line message
stating that nothing changed and why (every gathered block already carried a `<recommendation>`
element, or every dispatched question was still skipped after its repair attempt in step 3), still
followed by the still-skipped-question advisory when there was one.

If there were no questions at all, say so and stop (step 1) — nothing to report.
