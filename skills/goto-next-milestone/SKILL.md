# goto-next-milestone

Activates an already-defined milestone by updating `milestones/README.md` to point to it as the current milestone. The milestone directory must already exist (created by `/define-milestone-goal`); this skill creates no files or directories. Run this after `/finish-current-milestone` has cleared the current pointer to "none".

## Usage

```
/goto-next-milestone
```

No arguments. The milestone to activate is discovered automatically.

## Workflow

### 1. Check prerequisites

Read `milestones/README.md` and find the line whose prefix is `Current milestone:`. If that line is not `Current milestone: none` (i.e. it still points to an active milestone path), stop and tell the user to run `/finish-current-milestone` first.

### 2. Find the candidate milestone

Read `milestones/README.md` and scan `milestones/` to collect:
- All directories matching `milestone_<N>_<slug>/`
- All milestone dirs already listed in the `## Milestone History` section (these are completed)

The **candidates** are directories that exist in `milestones/` but do not appear in `## Milestone History`.

- **Zero candidates**: stop. Tell the user to run `/define-milestone-goal` first to create a milestone.
- **One candidate**: confirm the path and title with the user, then proceed.
- **Multiple candidates**: list them (number, slug, path) and ask the user which one to activate before proceeding. When deriving the number from the directory slug, strip leading zeros and treat it as an integer (e.g. `milestone_01_foo` → number `1`).

### 3. Update milestones/README.md

In `milestones/README.md`, overwrite the `Current milestone:` line with:

```
Current milestone: `milestones/milestone_<number>_<slug>/`
```

Leave the `## Current Milestone` heading, the `## Milestone History` section, and all other content unchanged; update `milestones/README.md` only — never write the pointer into `CLAUDE.md`.

### 4. Commit the activation

Read and follow the shared commit procedure at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/commit-procedure.md`, carrying out its steps yourself. Supply it these two inputs:

- **PATHS** — this skill's own change set: `milestones/README.md` (the file whose `Current milestone:` pointer it just overwrote).
- **SUBJECT** — `Milestone-activation: milestone_<number>_<slug>`.

The shared procedure owns the path-scoped staging, the dirty-own-path no-op guard, and the commit.

### 5. Confirm

On the success path — the commit in step 4 recorded the activation — print exactly one fixed terse status line and nothing else:

```
Milestone activated.
```

Do not add the activated milestone's path or title, or a next-step pointer.

If instead the step-4 dirty-own-path guard fired (the `Current milestone:` pointer was unchanged, so nothing was committed), do not print the terse line — print a single concise line stating that nothing changed and briefly why, e.g. `No change — the pointer already named that milestone; nothing committed.`
